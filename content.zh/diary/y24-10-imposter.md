# 10月

感觉有种不配得感。

10月7日，“板栗日记”正式更名为“板栗读博日记”，此日记为读博第一天。之后读完博，site还在的话，名字会改回来噢。（也有可能再次更名）打算就是更新日常，唠唠一些话题，也不一定是学习相关的吧，更重要的是记录一些思想和做过的事情。

### 2024-10-01

I would like to try use Engligh to write the diary on the site. It's hard to say the specific reason to do so, just for improving my ability. 

Today, many emails sent to my box. I definitely know that I cannot play anymore like these days in my phd student life. So I play the electric guitar, traveling, visit doctor, tutor high school student physics... I really did a lot in these three month. I met new people, learned a new instrument, grew stronger mental health. New life will soon come infront of me, and I feel somehow frustrated and anxious since I'm less confident. I'm afraid that I can not speak well in the presentation, I cannot do well in the research field. I need to hug the new challenge instead of running away off. Hope everything goes not bad. Some preparation before the freshman course may also needed. 

↑ 说的咋样，纯脑海想到啥就打了啥，之后会继续写的。
