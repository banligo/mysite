# 10月

感觉有种不配得感。

10月7日，“板栗日记”正式更名为“板栗读博日记”，此日记为读博第一天。之后读完博，site还在的话，名字会改回来噢。（也有可能再次更名）打算就是更新日常，唠唠一些话题，也不一定是学习相关的吧，更重要的是记录一些思想和做过的事情。

### 2024-10-01

I would like to try use Engligh to write the diary on the site. It's hard to say the specific reason to do so, just for improving my ability. 

Today, many emails sent to my box. I definitely know that I cannot play anymore like these days in my phd student life. So I play the electric guitar, traveling, visit doctor, tutor high school student physics... I really did a lot in these three month. I met new people, learned a new instrument, grew stronger mental health. New life will soon come infront of me, and I feel somehow frustrated and anxious since I'm less confident. I'm afraid that I can not speak well in the presentation, I cannot do well in the research field. I need to hug the new challenge instead of running away off. Hope everything goes not bad. Some preparation before the freshman course may also needed. 

↑ 说的咋样，纯脑海想到啥就打了啥，之后会继续写的。

(revised by ai) I am currently staying in the KEK dormitory and writing this. The travel was not bad, although a few unexpected things happened. It's not a big deal; I'll just forget those memories. However, one thing need to be emphasized: avoid changing foreigh money at the airport. The extra fees are very expensive. I only withdrew 10,000 Yen from and ATM, and the fee was 15 RMB! 

I arrived at KEK around 19:00, and it's now 23:30. I will write a scheduled email to my supervisor, brush my teeth, and then go to bed. I also need to think about what I should do tomorrow. 

Oh, and one more thing: my laptop was a little bent during the trip. It's an old laptop, so I'm not too concernedd about it. Good night.

码字于2024-10-08.

这天去办了以下在留卡相关的业务，然后下午去见了导师。研究室的人都挺nice的，感觉之后相处起来挺okay的哈哈。

把今天就当作是PhD的第一天吧。感到frustrated。。

### 2024-10-08 (PhDAY 2)

今天去参加入学式了，一路上累的啊... 意料之外的是看到了Chiba Ryotaro... 只能在电视里看到的人竟然在现实中看到了。面基！
但是没怎么聊，听说了他研究兴趣是超新星爆发。可惜没怎么深入了解过，英语也不好www，聊不起来wa。明天继续。我要拿到他签名。

### 2024-10-12 (PhDAY 6)

今天去了研究室了。oh my god。好多要学的啊。

感觉自己现在就是在最底下，什么都不知道。希望之后可以慢慢精进吧，一定多问！还好之前来过1年了，也有心理准备，感觉还行。李学长带我介绍了一下胡学长和王老师，嗯，都好厉害啊，老师还是北大毕业的，救命……
